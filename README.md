# Cubyz
Cubyz is a sandbox 3D voxel video game. It offers a native mod API and is currently just a project on training with LWJGL 3 and Java and is different to most other voxel games due to the fact that it uses random content generation to make every single world unique many some ways(including ores, materials and tools).

Cubyz can easily be forked to create a new game with 3D sandbox aspect.
## Requirements
Windows:

Type | Minimum | Recommended
-----|---------|------------
OS | Windows XP | Windows 7 or later
RAM | 3 GB | 4 GB or more
GPU | Any OpenGL 3.0 compatible | OpenGL 3.3+

Linux based / Mac:

Type | Minimum | Recommended
-----|---------|------------
RAM | 2 GB | 4 GB or more
GPU | Any OpenGL 3.0 compatible | OpenGL 3.3+

Those recommendations are system wide and required for Cubyz.

The exception is RAM, as Cubyz RAM usage varies. When gave little memory (256MB or less), due to how the GC works it will
get executed more often.
Meaning Cubyz won't crash for Out of Memory, but will have slow down due to GC pauses (unlikely to be visible with some GCs).
However with more memory the GC will make less pauses, and be trickier to free heap. Which will result in Cubyz having allocated
~900/1024MB but actually using 400/1024MB when shown in the debug menu.

Basically for the end user, this means Cubyz requires **minimum** around **128MB** of free RAM.
And is best played (**recommended**) with around **512MB** of free RAM.
